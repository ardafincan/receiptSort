# ReceiptSort

This is a simple pdf sorting program written with python for my friends business. It merges multiple pdf receipts and reads them using pypdf OCR. Then sorts them by surname attribute and gives a one single output pdf. 

You probably cant try this yourself because the OCR is fixed to one specific receipt format that business uses.
